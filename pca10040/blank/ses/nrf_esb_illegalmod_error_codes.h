/*
 * - Pseudo promiscuous mode has a "post processing step" (checks valid ESB frames
 * in received noise). As this adds a huge amount of computation overhead, it was
 * off-loaded to app_scheduler. Thus the library depends on app_scheduler.
 * - The promiscuous mode post processing step, optionally checks captured ESB frames
 * to be valid Logitech RF communication (additional vendor checksum, special length).
 * Thus it depends on the `logitacker_unifying" module and can't be used stand-alone.
 * This behavior could be changed by un-setting the `LOGITECH_FILTER` definition in
 * `nrf_esb_illegalmod.h`
 * - Additional operation modes for the radio are deployed and used by Logitacker.
 * For example the mode `NRF_ESB_MODE_PTX_STAY_RX` which puts the radio into PTX mode,
 * but toggles back AND STAYS in PRX mode after a single transmission. This was implemented
 * to reduce timing overhead of manual toggling between PRX and PTX to an absolute minimum
 * (utilizes PPI and proper SHORTS)
 * - The `nrf_esb_payload_t` data structure contains a boolean field called `noack`.
 * This boolean is connected to the no-acknowledge bit in the Packet Control Field (PCF)
 * of an ESB frame. The unmodified `nrf_esb` library unsets the no-acknowledge bit in the
 * PCF field if the `noack`boolean in the data structure is set to true (somehow reversed
 * behavior). This has been changed in the `nrf_esb_illegalmod` library: If the `noack`
 * boolean is set to true, the no-acknowledgment bit of the resulting ESB frame is set
 * (not unset) before transmission.
 *
 * Note: The term `illegal`in the library name refers to undocumented register settings
 * used for the nRF52844 radio, in order to obtain pseudo promiscuous RX capabilities.
 * It does not mean that something illegal (in common sense of the word) is done by this
 * library
